1.4.2 (2022-10)

	* Migration from Qt 4.x to Qt 5.

	* ChangeLog file was added.

	* Icon application was changed.

	* Fixed some minor compiler warnings.

	Thanks to Poly Electronics for his collaboration

1.4.1

	* Pure Qt4 version (Qt 3.x compatibility code removed) + bug fix

1.4.0 (2013-2)

	* PiKdev 1.4.0 is PikDev for Qt 4 This is the first version of PiKdev
	not based on KDE libs. This version is easier to maintain than the previous
	ones. It is functionnaly equivalent but offers new features.

	* Updated config bits editor : it supports the CONFIG syntax that is
	specific to PIC18 devices. This feature is also supported by cpik 0.7.2.
	A new config bits description scheme has been implemented for this purpose.

	* Integrated browser for HTML documentation coming with gputils 1.0.0 :
	This documentation is automatically generated from various sources from
	Microchip and provides many valuable information about ALL PIC devices
	currently available.

1.2.1 (2009-9)

	* Bug fix C parser caused an editor freeze, when a syntax error was located
	at the very end of a source file.

	* Totally new config bits editor : This very handy dialog allows you to
	choose the config bits needed by your application. This dialog generates two
	files: config_bits.h and a config_bits.asm. You just have to include one of
	these files in your application, depending on the language you use.
	Alternatively, you can drag the generated source code to the editor. CONFIG
	bits status is part of the project configuration.

1.2.0 (2009-7)

	* New support A new 10F device is supported by the buit-in programmer.

	* Netbooks support : Large dialog has been modified to be usable with machines
	equiped with a small screen (netbooks).

	* New support for C users (cpik compiler) : The project widget now allows a
	one click access to any function, variable or typedef in a project. For this
	feature, the source code is continuously parsed during edition. This feature
	also works for ".slb" (sources libraries) files, so any entry point in a
	source library can be reached. Really very handy when a project becomes
	important.

1.1.0 (2009-1)

	* pk2cmd and pikdev are now compatible : pk2cmd (the command line tool
	provided by Microchip for PicKit2 programmer) and pikdev have been both
	modified to become compatible. It means that every ehancement of the pk2cmd
	tool (new device support for example) will be immediately available under
	pikdev.

1.0.0 (2008-12)

	* pk2cmd based support of picKit2 USB programmer : This support is based on
	modified version of the Microchip pk2cmd tool and allows to program many new
	devices which was not previously supported.

0.9.2-1

	* Minor fixes : Support for 18F2420/30 and more was broken, due to errors in
	Microchip device files.

0.9.1-4

	* pkp build is automatic : pkp is now part of pikdev build, but the previous
	Makefile.pkp is still distributed: people who don't want to use KDE can build
	it separatly.

	* Italian translation is up-to-date Thanks to Michele Petrecca.

	* Some installation issues fixed.

0.9.1

	* Support for PicKit2 programmer from Microchip. : PicKit2 is supported trough
	Jeff Post's pk2 programming software. Access to pk2 is totally transparent for
	PiKdev users. Experimentation board from Microchip can directly be powered
	on/off from programming dialog. This support needs pk2 version 1.36 or newer.
	Thanks to Jeff for his collaboration.

	* Support for pkp as external programming tool : This support seems strange
	because it doesn't add any functionnality to PiKdev, because pkp and PiKdev
	share the same programming engine. In fact, pkp is supported as a demonstrator
	of "how to support an external programming tool". Programming tool authors who
	wish to have their software supported by PiKdev can look at pkp support to
	evaluate PiKdev requirements.

0.8.4

	* Partial rewrite of internal programmer driver integration framework : This
	rewrite is intended to prepare support for external programmers. The
	development of new device drivers have been simplified and is more generic:
	one can now write less code to support more devices.

	* New devices : Due to rewrite of driver integration framework, many new
	devices are now supported. please consult the exact list here. This list
	contains up to 158 device references, so I am not able to test all this stuff.
	All the devices support I have tested work, but I can't offer any guarantee
	about the others. I ask pikdev users to systematically report their
	experiences, so I will be able to maintain a list of really tested devices on
	this site.

	* User interface: Improved programmer widget : The programmer widget now
	display a progress bar and user interface is no longer freezed during long
	programming operations. Moreover, the config bits configuration widget now
	displays tooltips documenting each bit of the config registers. This feature
	was technically already here, but supported by a limited range of drivers. It
	is now usable with all devices and is very handy.

	* pkp revamped : pkp, the stand alone programmer build onto PiKdev programming
	engine now supports a complete command line mode. Old interactive mode is
	still available when one run pkp without any argument. Remember that pkp
	doesn't need neither Qt nor KDE to work.

0.8.2

	* Bug fix : Loading .hex files was broken in a very rare situation. This is
	now fixed.

	* New devices : 16f685, 16f687, 16f689, 16f690 are now supported.

	* User interface : Several users was confused by the availability of two
	distinct configuration widgets (in project mode and single-file mode).
	Depending on current mode, inappropriate widget is now locked, so there is no
	room for being confused.

	* .lnk files support : One can now include a .lnk (linker script) file into
	project: in this case, this file replaces the standard one.

	* Automatic indentation : PiKdev editor now provides automatic indentation of
	C source files. (CTRL-I). This features needs the (excellent) astyle program
	to be available in your system.

0.8.1

	* Bug fix : Support for 18Fxxx and 18FXX20 was broken since version 0.8.0.
	Fixed now.

0.8.0

	* New devices : The following new devices are now supported: 18F2550, 18F4550,
	18F2455, 18F4455.

	* Syntax highlight : Improved for better support of .slb source library and
	support for SFRs coloring.

	* C language support : A first support for C development is available. It has
	been designed for supporting cpik, my new C compiler for 18F devices. With C
	projects, only one click is sufficient to compile, link and assemble an
	application. Feedbacks are welcome.

0.7.2

	* Internationalization : Thanks to Andre Lohan, PiKdev GUI is now translated
	to german. Available languages are english, spanish, french, german.
	Translators for other languages are welcome, just drop me a mail.

	* New devices : The following new devices are now supported. 16F688, 16F684,
	12F683, 16F636, 12F635.

	* Programmation widget and pic base class : Improved for better support of
	devices with calibration words mapped in program or configuration memory.

	* User interface : Configuration widgets are now part of a config center.
	This config center defines a framework to allow integration of (future)
	configuration widgets dedicated to other programming languages.

0.7.1

	* Internationalization : Thanks to JAVIER FERNANDO VARGAS G, PiKdev GUI is now
	translated to spanish. I also translated it to french, so PiKdev now speaks
	three languages. People insterested by doing translation to another language
	are invited to contact me.

	* PiKdev mailing list : A mailing-list is now open to connect members of the
	pikdev users community. Please see contact page for details.

0.7.0

	* This is the first version for Mdk 10.0 (and KDE >3.1). Backward source
	compatibility with KDE 3.1 has been tested. Precompiled binaries are NOT KDE
	3.1 compatible.

	* Syntax HL: Because several syntax files provided with recent KDE versions
	address .asm files, I had to force the "good" syntax scheme (XPicAsm) from
	PiKdev. Before this fix, pic asm files was edited with Rockwell's 6502
	microprocessor editing scheme :-(.

	* KDE >3.1: Various modifications to cope with KDE API changes.

	* Session management: Window size, Iconbar settings are now restored.
	Previously opened files and project are also re-open when you run PiKdev.

	* External tool: JAVIER FERNANDO VARGAS G (fernandovargas@cable.net.co) sent
	me PiKloops, a little utility which generates code for timing loops. I
	partially rewrote the GUI (drag and drop support) to make it easily usable
	with PiKdev. PiKloops can be launched from PiKdev, and generated code can be
	dragged to PiKdev editors. Very easy to use, feedbacks are welcome. PiKloops
	is available on my download page, with Javier's authorization.

0.6.6a

	* Bug Fix: SegFault at exit with recent KDE distributions is now fixed.

0.6.6

	* Cosmetic: The programmer configuration widget has been modified because some
	users was confused by the "standard cards" combobox.

	* Installation: Old user-infertace files (.rc) are now deleted when a new
	version is installed, so interface changes are now immediatly visible.

	* Installation: RPM Conflict with recent KDE distributions about file
	"picsrc.xml" file has been removed.

	* Editor: Editor is now fully configurable (fonts, colors, etc..).

	* Syntax HL: A new syntax hightlight file is provided with full support for
	PIC18 instructions and recent gpasm directives.

	* Programming widget: has been revamped for users with low-res screen.

	CAUTION: PiKdev segfault on exit with recent KDE distributions. This does not
	prevent you from using it, but is clearly the result of a bug. Unfortunatly, I
	cannot reproduce this error on my machine for the moment. A fixed version will
	be released as soon as possible. Suggestions are welcome.

0.6.5c

	* Bug fix: A already fixed bug that caused crash in programmer configuration
	box reappeared because of bad integration of Mirko's work. Refixed now.

	* Bug fix: Pin polarity management for serial port programmer was totally
	missing, and prevented non JDM serial programmer from working.

0.6.5

	* New devices: 16F73/74/76/77 : Thank you to Keith Baker who wrote these two
	classes.

	* Support for programmers with data direction control line : Thank you to
	Mirko Panciri who wrote this support (mainly for Asix Picolo programmers).

	* Minor bug fixes.

	* More standard programmer configurations.

0.6.4

	* New devices: 16F627A, 16F628A, 16F648A (Tested).

	* Better support for missing/misconfigured ports : The programmer
	configuration widget does not crash anymore when a port is missing, and PiKdev
	gives better warning messages.

	* Disassembler (gpdasm) support : Allows to disassemble an existing hex file.
	Assembler configuration widget has been extended to support disassembler
	configuration.

	* Editor upgrade : Adding "Find next" and "Find previous" functionnalities.

	* Editor upgrade : Adding "Print file" functionnality.

0.6.3

	* New devices: 16F818/16F819 (tested) 16F87/16F88 (NOT tested). Please report
	your experiences with these devices.

	* New timings and clock rates : Some device/programmer couples (especially
	with 18F devices) cause problems with PiKdev. This version has been reported
	to fix problems mentionned with version 0.6.2.

0.6.2

	* Bug fix: an horrible uninitialized pointer randomly prevented project
	management from working properly. I strongly encourage users of version 0.6.1
	to install version 0.6.2 because this bug can crash PiKdev. Thanks to Mike
	Rothon for the bug report.

	* New devices supported: p16c61 p16c62 p16c620 p16c620a p16c621 p16c621a
	p16c622 p16c622a p16c62a p16c62b p16c63 p16c63a p16c64 p16c64a p16c65 p16c65
	p16c65a p16c65b p16c71 p16c710 p16c711 p16c716 p16c72 p16c72a p16c73 p16c73a
	p16c73b p16c74 p16c74 p16c745 p16c74a p16c74b p16c76 p16c765 p16c77 p16c773
	p16c774 p16c923 p16c924 p16cr62
	(CAUTION: 16C745 and 16C765 have been successfully tested, but other devices
	of this serie are not. Testers are welcome.).

	* Programmer timings have been changed to cope with some programming cards:
	Thanks to Don Kessler who pointed out these problems and tested fixes.
	However, it seems that problems remain with P16PRO40 programmers and 18Fxxx
	chips.

	* New standard pin configurations have been added.

0.6.1

	* New devices supported  :16F630, 16F676 (thanks to Sean A. Walberg).

	* Command line parsing has been improved and now supports project files. As a
	consequence, PiKdev can be run just by clicking project files.

	* A project can be opened by dragging project files from Konqueror to project
	widget (A previously opened project is closed). A file can be added to an
	opened project by the same way.

	* One can create several projects in the same directory. This is useful in the
	case of already existing directory trees.

	* Include (ie: .inc) files can now be inserted into projects. They are not
	assembled but they are part of project, so they appear in the project widget
	and can be edited.

	* Editor now includes an "autowrap lines" features (F12), as Kate does. Useful
	for long comment lines.

	* Native DOS source files are automatically recognized (they use CR-LF instead
	of LF), and are saved with their original end of lines. EOL status of any
	editor buffer can be changed at any moment. This feature allows to work in a
	mixed-OS environment.

	* Many minor improvements, bug fixes or security checks.

0.6 Another "important" release

	* Serial (JDM like) programmers are now supported. I added this support
	because this type of programmer is very popular. Moreover, you can use an USB
	to serial adapter on machines without serial port. PiKdev theoritically
	autodetects this kind of ports, but this feature is not tested because I do
	not have such an adapter. Here is some informations about the hardware I use.
	As a consequence, the programmer configuration widget has been revamped and
	now allows choice of a "standard" board in a predefined list.

	This list is currently reduced to 3 items but is intended to grow : please
	send me feedbacks about the programmer you use, with its configuration
	(schematics are welcome). A button allows you to save your own pins
	configuration.

	PiKdev maintains a separate configuration for parallel and serial ports so you
	can change from one to other with a simple click, whithout reconfiguring pins.
	Pins selection has been improved : only relevant pins are proposed and combo
	boxes now contain pin names (and not only pin numbers). Port can be
	dynamically selected, so you can simultaneously use different programmers on
	different ports.

	* An "open recent file" function has been added to the "file" menu.

	* Device autodetection is now implemented (for devices supporting device ID).
	The programming widget systematically tests the detected type against the
	current type and report mismatches.

0.5 This is a "major" release

	* New devices supported :12F675, 12F629 (tested).

	* Word editors in the programming widget have been modified to behave in a
	more natural way: typed values are automatically validated when you leave the
	widget and you are not obliged anymore to hit the return key.

	* I now provide a RPM version of PiKdev because some people had problems
	compiling and installing it. This RPM has been tested for Mandrake 9.1 and
	RedHat 9.0 distributions.

	* PiKdev now supports projects and uses relocatable mode with gpasm/gplink.
	Projects can be managed from popup menus in the project widget, or by a
	traditionnal menu/toolbar way. The following project-relative functionnalities
	have been added:
		Create Project
		Open Project
		Open Recent Project
		Edit Project
		Close Project
		Add file (source, object or library) to Project
		Add current source file to Project
		Remove file from Project

	* The old absolute mode (all the code is located in only one file) is still
	available and is selected when there is no open project.

	* Project is assembled/linked with only one click, and assembly occurs only if
	object file is not up to date. Provisions for compilation of "high level"
	languages (C, JAL, GPAL, other) already exists in the code.

0.4.4

	* New devices supported :16F873A, 16F874A, 16F876A, 16F877A.
	Gerardo (gpuga@gioia.ing.unlp.edu.ar) sent me a patch to process command line,
	so PiKdev can now be lauched by a click on an .asm or .hex file.

0.4.3

	* Bug fix in the hardware configuration widget (permuted checkboxes)

	IMPORTANT: The programming engine of PiKdev now comes with a non graphical
	user interface. This programm is named pkp (PiK Programmer) and is intended
	for use by people who do no use KDE or are not able to compile PiKdev because
	they have an old Linux distribution. pkp has a simple command line interface
	and have exactly the same programming capabilities as PiKdev, on the same
	devices. For lazy people, a pre-compiled version of pkp is available in the
	pikdev-[VERSION] directory which sould work with recent gcc 3.2 based
	distributions. Please see the installation section for details about
	compilation of pkp. (No KDE or Qt libraries needed). Compilation with pre-3.0
	gcc compiler is possible but may raise problems with namespaces. Please report
	such problems, I will modify the code to make it more nonstandard-C++
	tolerant.

0.4.2

	* Support for 18F1220, 18F1320, 18F2220, 18F2320, 18F4220 and 18F4320 devices.

0.4.1

	* Timing bug fix in 18F support.

	* Verification of programmed devices is now also implemented for 18Fxxx.
	"Must be 0" or "must be 1" bits in CONFIG registers are now automatically
	forced to the correct value. This feature prevents spurious error messages
	during verifications.

	* The hardware configuration widget now allows you to test your configuration.
	Just click on the desired checkbox, and verify the voltage with a multimeter
	on the device pins. You can also continuously send data to the interface and
	verify with an oscilloscope.

0.4

	* Asm configuration widget now allows to use parameters specified in source
	code by a LIST or PROCESSOR directive (No need to reconfigure when you
	assemble files for different target devices).

	* Add support for 16F870, 16F871, 16F872, 16F873, 16F874. Support for 16F876
	is now tested (but other devices of the same family are not, feedbacks about
	these devices are welcome).

	* Support for 18Fxxx devices now exists. The concerned devices are 18F242,
	18F248, 18F442, 18F448, 18F252, 18F258, 18F452, 18F458. Thanks to Manwlis
	Giannos (mgiannos2000@yahoo.gr) who wrote the programming code. This support
	is tested for 18F452 device. As usual, send feedback to alain.gibaud@free.fr.

0.3.4

	* Bug Fix in configuration widgets.

	* Include path for gpasm can now be relative to the source path.

	* Parallel ports are now automatically probed.

	* Configuration widgets are now documented by tooltips.

	* The asm configuration widget now explicitly signals devices supported by the
	PiKdev programmer.

0.3.3

	* Since KDE 3.1.0, Kate uses the "katepart" directory (instead of the "kate"
	one to store syntaxfiles (.xml). Installation procedure has been modified
	accordingly.

0.3.2

	* Improved installation.

	* Improved programmer widget.

0.3.1

	* Add internationalization support in source code, cleaner tarball, better
	installation process (the .xml kate syntaxfile is now automatically
	installed), bug fix.

0.3 (2003)

	* First public version.
